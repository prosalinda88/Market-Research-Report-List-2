<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soymeal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>By Process</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Soymeal market types can be classified based on the process used to extract oil from soybeans and produce soymeal. One such type is Type II market, which involves the use of solvent extraction method to obtain oil from soybeans. This process typically involves crushing soybeans and then using a solvent (such as hexane) to extract the oil. The remaining residue, after oil extraction, is then processed into soymeal, which is rich in protein and widely used as animal feed. Type II market refers specifically to the market for soymeal produced using solvent extraction method.</p></p>
