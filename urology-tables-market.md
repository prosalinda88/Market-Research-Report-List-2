<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urology Tables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With C-arm</li><li>Without C-arm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urology tables are medical equipment designed for urological examinations, surgeries, and procedures. The market for urology tables can be classified into two types based on the presence of a C-arm. Urology tables with C-arm compatibility allow for real-time imaging during procedures, enabling physicians to visualize internal structures. On the other hand, urology tables without C-arm lack this imaging capability, requiring physicians to rely on pre-operative imaging or other diagnostic tools. Both types serve the purpose of supporting urological procedures, but the presence or absence of C-arm functionality differentiates them in terms of imaging convenience.</p></p>
