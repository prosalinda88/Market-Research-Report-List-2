<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surge Suppressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Switch Type</li><li>Pressure Limiting Type</li><li>Flow Or Choke Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surge suppressors are electronic devices designed to protect electronic equipment from power surges or voltage spikes. There are three main types of surge suppressors in the market. </p><p>1. Switch Type Surge Suppressors: These suppressors cut off the power supply when a voltage surge is detected. They provide immediate protection by disconnecting the equipment from the surge. </p><p>2. Pressure Limiting Type Surge Suppressors: These suppressors use voltage-sensitive components like metal oxide varistors (MOVs) to divert excess voltage to the ground. They limit the voltage to a safe level by redirecting the surge energy away from the equipment. </p><p>3. Flow or Choke Type Surge Suppressors: These suppressors control the flow of voltage, reducing the transient energy's speed and magnitude. They use inductors or resistors to impede and dissipate the surge energy, protecting sensitive equipment.</p></p>
