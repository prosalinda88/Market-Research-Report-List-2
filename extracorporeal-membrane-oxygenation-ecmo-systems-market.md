<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems market consists of two types: VA ECMO (Veno-Arterial) and VV ECMO (Veno-Venous). VA ECMO supports both heart and lung function by oxygenating blood and returning it to the systemic circulation. It is mainly used for patients with severe heart or lung failure. On the other hand, VV ECMO solely supports the lungs by removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen to the blood before returning it to the venous system. It is commonly utilized for lung failure cases. Both ECMO systems are critical in providing temporary life support for patients.</p></p>
