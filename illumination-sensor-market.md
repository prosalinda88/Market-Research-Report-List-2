<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Illumination Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Back-Illuminated Sensor</li><li>Front-Illuminated Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Illumination sensor market types include back-illuminated sensors and front-illuminated sensors. Back-illuminated sensors are designed to improve low-light performance by placing the sensor's circuitry behind the pixels, allowing more light to reach the photodiode. This results in better image quality and higher sensitivity. On the other hand, front-illuminated sensors have their circuitry in front of the pixels, which can limit the amount of light reaching the photodiode. This may lead to reduced sensitivity and lower image quality in low-light conditions.</p></p>
