<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Stimulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Glycosides</li><li>Non-Cardiac Glycosides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac stimulant market consists of two types: cardiac glycosides and non-cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides are medications that increase heart muscle contractility, helping to regulate heart rhythm and treat congestive heart failure. Some common cardiac glycosides include digoxin and digitoxin. On the other hand, non-cardiac glycosides are compounds that have similar structures to cardiac glycosides but do not have the same effects on the heart. Instead, they have various other applications, such as anti-inflammatory properties or as cancer treatments.</p></p>
