<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide-based Flexible Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyimide flexible heater (no backing)</li><li>Aluminum / Copper Plated Polyimide Heater</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyimide-based flexible heaters are heating devices composed of a polyimide substrate. The first type is a polyimide flexible heater without a backing, which means it does not have an additional layer for support. This type is lightweight and thin, making it suitable for applications that require flexibility. On the other hand, the aluminum/copper-plated polyimide heater has a layer of aluminum or copper plated onto the polyimide substrate. This plated layer enhances the thermal conductivity, making it ideal for applications requiring rapid heat transfer or higher temperatures.</p></p>
