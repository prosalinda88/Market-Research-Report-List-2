<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Exhaust Blowers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Blower</li><li>Axial Blower</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial exhaust blowers market comprises different types of blowers, namely centrifugal blowers, axial blowers, and others. Centrifugal blowers utilize centrifugal force to move air or gas radially outward from the center, making them ideal for applications requiring high pressure and low airflow. Axial blowers, on the other hand, propel air or gas in a straight path parallel to the blower’s axis, making them suitable for applications requiring high airflow and low pressure. The "others" category encompasses various types of blowers that do not fall under centrifugal or axial blowers.</p></p>
