<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endoscopic Forceps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Endoscopic Forceps</li><li>Bipolar Endoscopic Forceps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Endoscopic Forceps market includes two main types: Monopolar Endoscopic Forceps and Bipolar Endoscopic Forceps. Monopolar Forceps are used in minimally invasive surgeries and function by transmitting electric current through the patient's body to cut or coagulate tissue. Bipolar Forceps, on the other hand, utilize two electrode tips to pass the current between them, preventing electrical shocks to the patient. Both types are essential tools in endoscopic procedures, contributing to precise surgical interventions and minimizing tissue damage.</p></p>
