<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Level Shifters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional Converter</li><li>Bidirectional Converter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Level shifters are electronic devices used to convert the voltage levels between two different circuits. The market for level shifters can be categorized into two types: unidirectional converters and bidirectional converters. Unidirectional converters allow the voltage level to shift in one direction only, either from a higher voltage to a lower voltage or vice versa. Bidirectional converters, on the other hand, enable voltage level shifting in both directions. These converters are crucial in various applications where different circuits with incompatible voltage levels need to communicate or interface with each other.</p></p>
