<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rapid Acting Insulins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lispro</li><li>Aspart (NovoLog)</li><li>Glulisine (Apidra)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rapid-acting insulins, such as Lispro, Aspart (NovoLog), and Glulisine (Apidra), are a type of insulin used to manage high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. These insulins work quickly to lower blood sugar after a meal, typically within 15 minutes to an hour after injection. They are designed to mimic the natural insulin response in the body and prevent high blood sugar spikes. Rapid-acting insulins are typically used in combination with long-acting insulins to provide optimal blood sugar control throughout the day.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Rapid Acting Insulins Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type 1 Diabetes</li><li>Type 2 Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rapid-acting insulins are used in the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce insulin, requiring individuals to use insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels. In type 2 diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or becomes resistant to its effects. Rapid-acting insulins are designed to quickly lower blood sugar levels after a meal, as they have a faster onset of action and shorter duration compared to other types of insulin.</p></p>
