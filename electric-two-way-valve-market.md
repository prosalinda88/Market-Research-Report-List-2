<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Two Way Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Electric Two Way Valve</li><li>Pilot Operated Electric Two Way Valve</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric two-way valve market can be categorized into two types: direct acting electric two-way valves and pilot operated electric two-way valves. </p><p>Direct acting electric two-way valves are controlled by electric actuators that directly open or close the valve. They are commonly used in small to medium-size applications, such as domestic water systems, where the flow rate and pressure requirements are relatively low.</p><p>On the other hand, pilot-operated electric two-way valves are controlled by a combination of a smaller pilot valve and a larger main valve. The pilot valve regulates the flow or pressure, which then controls the opening and closing of the main valve. These valves are typically used in larger-scale applications, such as industrial processes or HVAC systems, where higher flow rates and pressures are required.</p></p>
