<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Acoustic Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-Beam Type</li><li>Through Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ultrasonic Acoustic Sensor Market consists of two types: through-beam type and through type. Through-beam type sensors use two separate units – a transmitter and a receiver – placed opposite each other. An object passing through the sensor interrupts the ultrasonic beam, triggering a response. Through type sensors, on the other hand, incorporate both the transmitter and receiver in a single unit. They emit ultrasonic waves and analyze the changes, such as amplitude, frequency, or time, to detect objects in their vicinity.</p></p>
