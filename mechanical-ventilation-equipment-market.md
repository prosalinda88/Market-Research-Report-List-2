<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mechanical Ventilation Equipment market consists of two main types: non-invasive and invasive ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation involves the delivery of respiratory support to patients through a mask or nasal prongs, without the need for any invasive procedures. This is often used for patients with less severe respiratory conditions. In contrast, invasive ventilation requires the insertion of a tube into the patient's airway, usually via intubation or tracheostomy. This method is employed for patients with more critical respiratory conditions or those who cannot adequately breathe on their own.</p></p>
