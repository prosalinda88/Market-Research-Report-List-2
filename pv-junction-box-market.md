<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Junction Box Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Potting PV Junction Box</li><li>Non-Potting PV Junction Box</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PV Junction Box market is categorized into two types: Potting PV Junction Box and Non-Potting PV Junction Box. Potting PV Junction Boxes are sealed with a protective material to prevent water and dust ingress, making them highly durable and suitable for harsh environments. On the other hand, Non-Potting PV Junction Boxes do not have a sealing material, making them more cost-effective but potentially less resistant to environmental factors. Both types have their own advantages and are used in solar panel installations based on specific requirements and budget considerations.</p></p>
