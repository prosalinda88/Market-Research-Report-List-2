<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccator Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum</li><li>Non-Vacuum</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A desiccator cabinet is used to store and protect moisture-sensitive materials. It is available in two market types: vacuum and non-vacuum. In the vacuum market, the desiccator cabinet creates a low-pressure environment by removing air, resulting in a higher level of moisture removal. This type is ideal for extremely sensitive materials. On the other hand, the non-vacuum market does not remove air, but relies on a seal and desiccant to absorb moisture. This type suits less sensitive materials and is more cost-effective. Both market types serve the purpose of preserving and protecting moisture-sensitive items.</p></p>
