<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler Wet & Dry Pipe Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Pipe System</li><li>Dry Pipe System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fire Sprinkler Wet and Dry Pipe Systems are types of fire protection systems used in buildings and facilities. Wet Pipe Systems are the most common, where water is constantly stored in pipes and ready to be released when a fire is detected. Dry Pipe Systems, on the other hand, are used in cold environments or areas prone to freezing. These systems store compressed air instead of water and release it to fill the pipes before water is discharged, which helps prevent freezing and pipe burst.</p></p>
