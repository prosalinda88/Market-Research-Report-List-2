<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dam Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distributed System</li><li>Centralized System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the Dam Monitoring market, there are two main types of systems: Distributed System and Centralized System. </p><p>A Distributed System refers to a network of sensors located at multiple points within a dam structure. These sensors collect data on various parameters like water level, temperature, and structural integrity. This data is then transmitted and analyzed in a decentralized manner, allowing for real-time monitoring and early detection of any issues or potential failures. </p><p>On the other hand, a Centralized System involves a single control center that collects data from different sensors placed throughout the dam. The data is centralized and analyzed in one location, offering a comprehensive view of the dam's condition. It enables efficient monitoring, maintenance planning, and decision-making to ensure dam safety.</p></p>
